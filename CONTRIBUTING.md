## Releasing

- Produce requirements.txt: __pipreqs --force --savepath ./requirements.txt --ignore bin,hazen-venv ./__
- Check what requirements have been edited as pipreqs is not perfect e.g. scikit_image instead of skimage
- Make sure all tests are passing
- Update version in hazenlib/\_\_init\_\_.py, remove 'dev'.
- Update docs (try sphinx-apidoc for autodocumentation of modules)
