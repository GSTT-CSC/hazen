Map of local SNR across a flood phantom slice.

Introduction
============

The SNR for each voxel in an image (of a flood phantom) is estimated as the SNR
of a ROI centred on that voxel following the single image SNR method of McCann
et al. [1]_. The SNR map can show variation in SNR caused by smoothing filters.
It also highlights small regions of low signal which could be caused by micro-
bubbles or foreign bodies in the phantom. These inhomogeneities can erroneously
reduce SNR measurements made by other methods.


Algorithm overview
==================
1. Apply gaussian blur to original image to create smooth image.
2. Create noise image by subtracting smooth image from original image.
3. Create image mask to remove background using e.g. Otsu's method.
4. Calculate SNR using McCann's method and overlay ROIs on image.
5. Estimate local noise as standard deviation of pixel values in ROI centred on
    a pixel. Repeat for each pixel in the noise image, excluding pixels where
    the ROI contains one or more points not in the image mask.
6. Plot the local noise as a heat map.
