ACR Ghosting

Calculates uniformity for slice 7 of the ACR phantom.

This script calculates the percentage signal ghosting in accordance with the ACR Guidance.
This is done by first defining a large 200cm2 ROI before placing 10cm2 elliptical ROIs outside the phantom along the
cardinal directions. The results are also visualised.
