| *hazen* is a software framework for performing automated analysis of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) Quality Assurance data.

It provides automatic quantitative analysis for the following measurements of MRI phantom data:

- Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
- Spatial resolution
- Slice position and width
- Uniformity
- Ghosting
- Relaxometry

We have also built an interactive web-based implementation of *hazen*, which is we refer to as the `hazen web app <https://github.com/GSTT-CSC/hazen-web-app>`_.
